I have used Python 3 for this work.
Libraries I have used are: pandas, numpy and sys.



Problem Statement - (https://github.com/InsightDataScience/prediction-validation/)

Introduction
You are a data engineer working at a financial institution that analyzes real-time stock market data. To determine the best trading strategy, the company's data scientists created a machine learning model to predict the future price of a stock every hour, and they want to test it on real-time stock data.
Before deploying the model, they want you to help test how accurate their predictions are over time by comparing their predictions with newly arriving real-time stock prices.

Challenge summary
You will read two different files, one provides the actual value of each stock every hour and the second lists the predicted value of various stocks at a certain hour during the same time period.
You will obtain the average error by calculating the average difference between the actual stock prices and predicted values over a specified sliding time window.
